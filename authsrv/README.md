# Authsrv

This is an attempt at building a slackbot with Google Drive access.
For now I am stuck with Slack asking for `Authentication token` as a request parameter.

Are they asking for the OAuth token? How can I get the `bot_access_token` out of the OAuth2 lib?
And how should I use it (expiration, renewal, etc...)?
